It's strongly recommended to install Terminator using your OS's package
system rather than using setup.py yourself.

Packages are known to be available under the name "terminator" for the 
following Linux Distributions

* Arch Linux
* CentOS
* Debian
* Fedora
* Gentoo
* OpenSUSE
* Ubuntu

If you maintain terminator for an OS other than these, please get in touch
or issue a PR to this file.

If you don't have this option, please make sure you satisfy Terminator's
dependencies yourself:

 * Python 3.5+ recommended:

     Debian/Ubuntu: python3
     Fedora/CentOS: python3
     FreeBSD: python37

 * Python GTK and VTE bindings:
     
     Fedora/CentOS: python3-gobject python3-configobj python3-psutil vte291 
		    keybinder3 intltool gettext
     Debian/Ubuntu: python3-gi python3-psutil python3-configobj 
		    gir1.2-keybinder-3.0 gettext intltool
     FreeBSD:       py37-psutil py37-configobj keybinder-gtk3 py37-gobject3 gettext 
		    intltool

If you don't care about native language support or icons, Terminator
should run just fine directly from this directory, just:

    ./terminator --help

And go from there.  Manpages are available in the 'doc' directory.

To install properly, run:

    ./setup.py install --record=install-files.txt

See --help for an overview of the available options; e.g. --prefix to
install to a custom base directory, and --without-gettext to avoid
installing natural language support files.

setup.py supports basic uninstallation provided --record was used for
installation as above:

    ./setup.py uninstall --manifest=install-files.txt

Note that uninstall will avoid removing most empty directories so it
won't harm e.g. locale or icon directories which only contain Terminator
data.  It also won't rebuild the icon cache, so you may wish to:

     gtk-update-icon-cache -q -f ${PREFIX}/share/icons/hicolor

Where ${PREFIX} is the base install directory; e.g. /usr/local.
